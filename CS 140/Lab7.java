	Assignment: Lab6 - Write a program that simulates a lottery. Your program should have an array
					   of five integers named lotteryNumbers. Use the Random class to generate a
					   random number in the range of 0 through 9 for each element in the array.
					   Your program should either read in five integers that represent a personâ€™s
					   lottery picks or let the computer to select numbers for the user. The program
					   should then display the number of digits that match the lottery numbers.
