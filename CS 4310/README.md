# Projects

The following files of the Nachos OS have been implemented:

<ul>
	<li>Within threads:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Condition2.java</li>
		<li>KThread.java</li>
		<li>Alarm.java</li>
		<li>Communicator.java</li>
		<li>PriorityScheduler.java</li>
		<li>UserProcess.java</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Within userprog:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>UserProcess.java</li>
	</ul>
</ul>

These files implement condition variables, forking and joining threads, signaling threads with alarm, communicating between threads, scheduling threads based on priority, and file system calls for user programs.
