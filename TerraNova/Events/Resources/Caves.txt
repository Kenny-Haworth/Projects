0) Failure

Your party ventures south towards the mountains to gather materials.
The climate is much colder and wetter in this region. The terrain becomes rocky and steeply inclined.
You find large cave openings that lead deep into the mountain. The caves are damp and dark.
The caves narrow further in, so your party splits into small groups, with each group tackling a different cave entrance.
You have brought pickaxes to mine the precious stones in these caves.
The stones will be good for making tools and reinforcing Terra Nova's walls.
Your group stays near enough to the cave's entrance to have enough light to see with.

Sometime later, your group has ventured farther into the cave in the search of more stones now that your eyes have adjusted to the darkness.
Suddenly, a bright pair of orange eyes blaze out of the darkness, staring directly at you!
Your group turns and begin stumbling through the dark back towards the cave entrance, but turning your backs was a bad idea!
With a shriek, the eyes leap forward with astounding speed, and you can make out razor-sharp teeth sink into the leg of the man next to you!
He yells but quickly falls unconscious! It seems the bite of this animal has some sort of venomous effect to immobilize their prey!
You all drop your packs and run for the cave entrance, cutting yourselves on jagged rocks and rough cave walls as you feel towards the exit.
Several of your men fall to the beast. Some try to strike at it with their pickaxes but it is too fast to take in close quarters.
You finally see the way out and emerge into the sunlight. You turn and see the glowing orange eyes slowly take form.
It's a Troodon! It pauses momentarily as it enters the light, shrieks, and then continues to chase after you!
As you run, you see the other groups shout and run out of their caves as well, with more Troodons chasing after them!

You eventually shake off the Troodons and regroup with what is left of your party.
You all want to return and help those that fell to the Troodons, but you know it will only end worse, as you have nothing to fight them with...
For now, you will have to hope they escape the Troodons and make it back to Terra Nova...

Perhaps if you decide to return here some other time, you should consider crafting a weapon that can take out the Troodons from a distance...

1) Success and Failure

Your party ventures south towards the mountains to gather materials.
The climate is much colder and wetter in this region. The terrain becomes rocky and steeply inclined.
You find large cave openings that lead deep into the mountain. The caves are damp and dark.
The caves narrow further in, so your party splits into small groups, with each group tackling a different cave entrance.
You have brought a few muskets to protect yourselves and pickaxes to mine the precious stones in these caves.
The stones will be good for making tools and reinforcing Terra Nova's walls.
Your group stays near enough to the cave's entrance to have enough light to see with.

Sometime later, your group has ventured farther into the cave in the search of more stones now that your eyes have adjusted to the darkness.
Suddenly, a bright pair of orange eyes blaze out of the darkness, staring directly at you!
Wielding a musket, you quickly get a shot off, flinging the eyes back into the darkness as you hear the beast shriek from the impact.
You reload but the cave has fallen silent. It seems there are no other attackers. You check on the beast and discover it is a Troodon!
Troodons are vicious cave-dwellers, with bites that render their prey unconscious. The one before you has a row of sharp teeth and long claws.
Not every group had someone with a musket. You should check on them to make sure they are okay...

As your group finds their way out of the cave and emerge into the sunlight, you are met with shouts and screams!
The other groups are running from their caves, closely followed by Troodons!
You and musket-wielders from other groups join to help take them out.
Your party eventually kill enough of them to force the remaining Troodons back into the caves.
It will not be safe to return to the caves for now.
Several groups still have the stones they mined, but it was at the cost of several lives...

Perhaps if you decide to return here some other time, you should consider bringing enough muskets for everyone...

As your group finds their way out and emerge into the sunlight, you find the other groups were also attacked by Troodons but are safe.
Continuing to mine will be risky now that you know Troodons are in the area. You have all already managed to mine a good deal of resources.
It is time to head back to Terra Nova.
