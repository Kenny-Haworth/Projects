0) Failure

Your party heads east to scavenge for materials at the riverbeds.
There is wood and hardened stones here that will be good for making tools.
As you are gathering, you notice a small dinosaur standing on a nearby boulder, observing the party.
You point it out to everyone else. The dinosaur cocks its head. It seems harmless enough, so your party continues to gather.
You feel like you know this dinosaur from somewhere, but you're not sure where...

Sometime later, one of your men gets too close to the dinosaur. It shrieks, and a large fan bristles out on either side of its neck!
You recognize it now, it's a Dilophosaurus! The Dilophosaur spits venom into the face of the man who stumbled too close!
The man falls to the ground, clutching his eyes from the venom!
Not satisfied, the Dilo turns to the rest of your party and approaches, making hissing noises like a rattle snake!
The hissing seems to have attracted other Dilophosaurs as well! You have brought nothing to fight with, and will have to run!
Your party drop their packs and take off, but the Dilophosaurs manage to pick off several of you by pouncing with their sharp claws...

Perhaps if you decide to return to the riverbeds some other time, you should consider bringing something to fend the Dilophosaurs off...

The Dilo turns to the rest of your party and advances, making hissing noises like a rattle snake!
The hissing seems to have attracted other Dilophosaurs as well! You have brought a few spears to fight with, so your party tries to fend them off!
To keep a good distance from the spitting poison, you hurl the spears at the Dilophosaurs. They easily bring them down or severely injure them.
However, your party does not have enough spears to take out all the Dilophosaurs. After your party has thrown the few you have, you are defenseless.
Some of your men run to pull their spears out of the Dilophosaurs they have already hit, while your men without spears throw sharp stones at the Dilo's.
Eventually your party emerges victorious, but the Dilophosaurs managed to pick off several of you by pouncing with their sharp claws...

Perhaps if you decide to return to the riverbeds some other time, you should consider bringing enough spears for everyone...
