3) Muskets

Your people have crafted several low-power muskets!
It took several tries to get the right ratio of sulfur, charcoal, and saltpeter to make the gunpowder.
They take a long time to reload and the ammuniation takes a lot of materials, but they will be great for ranged combat!

4) Assault Rifles

Your people have crafted several fully-automatic assault rifles!
Creating several batches of muskets has given you the opportunity to experiment on ranged weapons.
You now know how to make weapons of higher caliber!
The ammuniation is expensive to craft, but the destructive power of the assault rifles is more than worth it.

5) A Rocket Launcher

You have been experimenting with larger quantities of gunpowder exploding all at once, and you wonder if you can weaponize it.
TNT is volatile and unreliable for defending Terra Nova, but a rocket launcher would be great for taking down large dinosaurs.
Your scientists will require a lot of materials to research this weapon, as there will be a lot of trial-and-error.
However, your scientists finally perfect their research and produce a rocket launcher!
