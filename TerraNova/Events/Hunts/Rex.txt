0) Failure

Your party travels far north into Tyrannosaurus territory for food.
Lush jungle surrounds you. There is plenty of fruit and berries to pick.
It seems herbivores do not venture into this region, which is why there is so much food...

Sometime later, your party has harvested a great deal of food and are ready to head back to Terra Nova.
As you walk back, you feel a faint rumbling in the toes of your feet. You glance at a puddle of water next to you.
Ripples emanate from the center of the puddle and spread outward during each rumble.
An earthquake? No...
The rumbling is growing steadily louder. It's massive footsteps!
A terrible roar splits the air! It's a T-rex!
Your party has brought assault rifles as defense, but in this thick jungle the rex isn't visible until it is almost directly on top of you!
Unable to get many shots off, the rex quickly crushes and devours whoever is in it's path!
Fortunately, it is easy to drop your packs, run, and hide in the jungle, although the rex still manages to get a few of you...

Later, you finally make it back to Terra Nova and regroup with the others. Thankfully, almost all the members of your party have made it back.
That wasn't so bad!

You sit with your hunting party in the safety of Terra Nova's walls and begin to recover.
You drink your fill from your water canteen and look deep into it, reflecting on the men you lost today...
...and the water ripples...#darkStatementDelay
Your eyes widen. Suddenly wide awake, you shout at the top of your lungs, #noNewLine
"T-REX! RAISE THE DEFENSES! EVERYONE ON THE WALLS!!!"#60
Everyone stares at you, thinking you surely must be reliving the traumatic event earlier today.
But the shaking grows stronger, and you yell yet again.
Starting to realize the situation, the wall guards spring to life and begin arming the outter walls with your strongest weapons.
The beast must have perceived you entering it's territory as a threat, and followed your scent back to Terra Nova!
Before your men can fully prepare, it emerges into the clearing surrounding the outer walls and charges!
It tears an opening into the wall and savagely begins to crush and destroy everything in its path...

The battle was long and bloody, but the beast finally falls. Terra Nova is in ruins.
There are several holes in the walls, your weapons cache was destroyed, and nearly all the houses and buildings were demolished.
The granary was crushed in the battle as well. The meat from the rex will not be enough to replace the food that was lost.
It will take all your materials to rebuild Terra Nova.
Almost everyone died...

Perhaps if you decide to return to the T-rex breeding grounds some other time, you should consider bringing something powerful enough to kill a rex...

An earthquake? No...
The rumbling is growing steadily louder. It's massive footsteps!
A terrible roar splits the air! It's a T-rex!
Your party has brought assault rifles and a rocket launcher as defense, but in this thick jungle the rex isn't visible until it is almost directly on top of you!
Luckily, your man with the rocket launcher manages to land a direct hit on the rex, severely wounding it.
However, the rex still manages to crush and devour several members of your team before you can bring it down.
At least the animal will make for some good meat in addition to all the fruit and berries you harvested...

Perhaps if you decide to return to the T-rex breeding grounds some other time, you should consider bringing a second rocket launcher...
