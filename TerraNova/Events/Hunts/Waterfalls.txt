0) Failure

Your scavenging party hikes to the waterfalls a few miles east of Terra Nova.
You find edible mushrooms and fish in the rivers and streams beneath the waterfalls.
While gathering food, your party suddenly hears long, udulating calls from all around you!
Before you can retreat, half a hundred small Velociraptors, each about the size of your foot, emerge from the foliage and surround you!
Your men try to kick them and fight them off, but the Velociraptors get back up and lunge again!
Unable to win the fight, your party drop their packs and run for it!
Unfortunately, several members of your party trip and fall to the Velociraptors' sharp fangs and are quickly swarmed by them...

Perhaps if you decide to return here some other time, you should craft some spears to fend off the Velociraptors...

1) Success and Failure

Your scavenging party hikes to the waterfalls a few miles east of Terra Nova.
You find edible mushrooms and fish in the rivers and streams beneath the waterfalls.
While gathering food, your party suddenly hears long, udulating calls from all around you!
Before you can retreat, half a hundred small Velociraptors, each about the size of your foot, emerge from the foliage and surround you!
Some of you have come with sharp spears and are able to defend yourselves, retreating with the food you have managed to scavenge so far.
However, those without spears can only kick at the Velociraptors, who simply get back up and lunge at them again!
Unable to protect themselves, they panic and run off into the jungle, closely followed by several Velociraptors...

Perhaps if you decide to return to the riverbeds some other time, you should consider bringing enough spears for everyone...
