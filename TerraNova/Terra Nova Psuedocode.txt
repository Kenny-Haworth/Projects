This file contains all planned ideas for the TerraNova game

Ideas:
	weather events, droughts
	disease (medicine cure?)
	difficulty levels??
	lucas - each set of 10 days increases his chances of finishing his code to open the portal, exponential function?
	sound files <===== this would be awesome. Rain in background on rainy days!
	new population are children? three/five/ten days and they become adults?
	have different defense numbers depending on attack - dino's or sixers
		optionally adding defenses that defend against certain types of dino's? (troughs, fire lines, barricades, guns, etc)
	create exe file?
	highlight text in purple for input
	happiness maxes out at 100, but if that limit is hit additional resources are given
	immersive randomized text when attacks aren't sent between events

Program Begins and shows a menu with the following options
	New Game
	Tutorial
		This goes through the basics of the game and how to play. It then returns the user to the main menu.
	Credits
		Just a statement of me and who helped me make the game

New Game is selected.

Exposition is read out. (warning of Lucas)

the following loops each day:

day is read out
	after day 10, Lucas becomes a chance. 1/100 chance next 10 days tested each day. 1/50 next 10 each day. so on and so forth

statistics of the colony are read out

	statistics include:
		happiness (too low and the population has a higher chance to refuse to fight, various bad things(fights, disturbed peace, etc))
		food (no food means population decreases each day exponentially for each day the day terminates with 0 food)
		population (people. more people means you need more food, but fewer people means weaker defenses) (0 people and GAME OVER)
		offense (the ability to fight back when the colony is attacked and harvest materials in more dangerous places)
		defense (the ability to withstand strong enemy offense against the colony, whether it be dinos or sixers)
		materials (needed to create things)

		(depending on difficulty, the above stats may be lower or higher and decrease or increase at a higher or lower rate)
		

options are displayed to harvest resources and increase colony stats. You may do 2 each day (random events intermingled). The user may:

	Hold a festival (increases population, costs materials)
		may hold a larger festival for more population but more material cost
		Festivals can only get a maximum of half the total population in increase (for example: pop 100, increase only max 50)
	Hold a feast (increases happiness, costs food(may hold a larger feast for more happiness but greater food cost))

	Go on a hunt (increases food) (different hunt locations may net more food, but can be more dangerous and result
					in a loss of population and decrease in happiness if someone dies)

		locations: (in each case, offensive capabilities determine success rate. you either get food or lose people, with a small chance of both if you lose people first)
			1 (low amount of food, no danger)
			2 (low-moderate amount of food, low danger)
			3 (moderate amount of food, moderate danger)
			4 (moderate-high amount of food, moderate-high danger)
			5 (high amount of food, high danger)
			6 (very high amount of food, very high danger)

	Gather materials (used to increase offensive or defensive capabilities)
		1 

	Spend materials (this is innate and will not count of one of the 2 things you are allowed to do each day)
		Rovers (covers open ground, searches for resources each day and Lucas)
		motorcycles (covers closed terrain and deep forests, searches for resources each day and Lucas)
			a balance of rovers and motorcycles is best for finding Lucas; Rovers cover more ground and find more resources though, but they also cost more)
		Defenses
			Towers 			(low defense increase, low material cost)
			Reinforced Gates	(low-medium defense increase, higher material cost)
			Enchanced Weaponry	(medium defense increase, medium material cost)
			Strengthened gates
			etc.


Randomized Events
	In the event of an attack
		Dino attack
			same chance of attack the whole game
			dino's get stronger after each set of 10 days
		Sixer attack
			chance of sixer attack begins after 10 days, increases again after day 20 and remains the same for the rest of the game
			sixer's attack get stronger after each set of 15 days

In the event of Sixer Victory
	Terra Nova is taken, some manage to escape into a makeshift base in the forest. all stats are quartered (1/4)
	Twice the chance for a dino attack each day
	sixers have a tiny chance to find you each day, increasing slowly over time. If they find you, a huge wave is sent (the next day) The user will be warned of their compromised position.
		if you conquer the wave you take back Terra Nova
		if you lose to the wave, GAME OVER
	You may choose to fight to reclaim Terra Nova; your offense must be greater than their defense, which is the defense of your forces before you lost Terra Nova plus (1/4) their offense when they took Terra Nova

Resources are given from the other side of the portal at the end of the day. you get more of what you need.
	if the portal is destroyed, you get nothing

At the end of each day, the chance to find Lucas is rolled, depending on your motorcyles and land rovers.
If you find him, Lucas can either be taken into custody or he will run again. If he manages to escape his research is set back,
but it will be more difficult to find him in the future. Otherwise he is killed.

If you don't find him, the chance for Lucas to finish his portal is rolled. If he finishes the portal, there is a 100% chance over the next
ten days of enemy militia attack, with very difficult waves. Exposives may be made out of materials to blow the portal, but this
results in a decrease in population and no more resources at the end of the day. FIND LUCAS!

end of loop

at game over, create a text document (that you append data to) that gives the date, time, and final day the user got to as well as what gave them their game over,
maybe have a high score file and save/load game file
