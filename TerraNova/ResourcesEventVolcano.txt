0) Failure

Your party ventures northwest towards the volcano to gather materials.
The climate begins to grow hotter, the terrain becomes rocky, and the trees and foliage become sparser as you near the volcano.
You are eventually hiking uphill in the open, with no cover for miles.
However, this makes you feel safe, as you are confident you can spot any predators from miles away before they can reach you.
You hope there will be enough materials at the volcano's peak to make the trip worthwhile...

Sometime later, your party is nearing the peak. It is starting to get very hot. You shield your eyes from the sun and look around.
Instead of seeing the blue, open sky you see large dots on your vision. You blink rapidly to clear it, but the dots stay there.
You must be looking at clouds, because the objects are over 50 feet wide. But these clouds are a solid brown. The color looks more like a bird...
As you ponder the nature of the objects, they suddenly become much closer, no more than a hundred feet above the ground!
You can make them out clearly now! They're Quetzalcoatlus! Massive, flying carnivores! You warn your party as the Quetzals dive towards you!

Unfortunately, there is not very much your party can do in defense.
Muskets are the only form of protection you have brought, but they seem only to be a thorn to the Quetzals, making them squawk louder and attack with more energy.
The barren landscape that once seemed to protect you from predators is now a trap, as you will be unable to lose the Quetzals until you make it to the treeline!
Your men are picked up by the Quetzals strong forearms, flown high into the sky, and released.
As you run the miles back to forest's edge, you hear the sickening sound of their bones snapping as they hit the hard earth all around you...

You make it back to safety, but none of your men have made it back with you. It is time to go back to Terra Nova...
Perhaps if you decide to return to the volcano some other time, you should consider bringing something powerful enough to kill Quetzals...

The barren landscape that once seemed to protect from predators is now a trap, as you will be unable to lose the Quetzals unless you can make it to treeline miles away.
Your party has brought muskets and a few assault rifles as defense, so it will be better to stand and fight with what weapons you have.
The Quetzals pick up your men with their strong forearms, fly them high into the sky, and release them.
As you fight, you hear the sickening sound of their bones snapping as they hit the hard earth all around you.
Your party fire round after round into the Quetzals, but the muskets are only a thorn to the them, making them squawk louder and attack with more energy.
Luckily, the assault rifles manage to bring several of them down. They are able to shoot the Quetzals from much further away with a faster fire rate.

After a long and bloody battle, your party is victorious.
Many lives were lost, but their sacrifices will mean nothing if you do not reach the peak and get resources from this trip.
What is left of your party push to the peak and find a plethora of volcanic rock, obsidian, and precious stones.
Your party gathers until they are exhausted from the previous battle and the heat, and you all begin the long trek home...

Perhaps if you decide to return to the volcano some other time, you should consider bringing more assault rifles to kill any Quetzals that attack...

Your party has brought assault rifles as defense, so your men unload on the diving Quetzals!
Since everyone has a rifle, you are able to stand your ground and take out the Quetzals before they can grab anyone and fly off with them.
The battle is short, and your party is victorious. The landscape is once again silent.
You push to the peak of the volcano and find a plethora of volcanic rock, obsidian, and precious stones.
Your party gathers until they are exhausted from the previous battle and the heat, and you all begin the long trek home.
The trip was a success!
