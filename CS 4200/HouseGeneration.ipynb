    "In this assignment, you will be writing a constraint satisfaction program in AnsProlog and solving it with `clingo` -- a piece of Potassco, the Potsdam Answer Set Solving Collection, a bundle of tools for Answer Set Programming developed at the University of Potsdam. \n",
    "\n",
    "This will involve writing a program that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Infers facts about the state of the world (e.g. is a location safe for placing a wall given the constraints listed below)\n",
    "* Makes choices about how and where to place a house\n",

    "Answer Set Programming is a declarative programming paradigm, in opposition to the more common imperative programming paradigm.  In an imperative programming paradigm, you tell the computer what to do.  In a declarative programming paradigm, you tell the computer what your desired result is, and then it finds a solution that matches your prescribed solution.  The most common declarative programming language is SQL -- wherein users don't tell the database how to find the results they want, they instead tell the program what kind of results they want and SQL does it.\n",

    "This notebook exists solely for running `clingo` and printing the results in a pretty manner.  The logic of the program exist in `world_gen.lp` that generates a map based on a set of constraints.  Go over there now and get a feel for the code. \n",
