# Super Mario Bros AI

This project uses machine learning techniques to train an agent to play the original NES Super Mario Bros. It uses Deep Q Learning with a Convolutional Neural Network that is fed the raw pixel input of the game screen.

<ul>

<li><strong>project.py</strong> contains the final implemenation of the project.</li>
<li><strong>originalProject.py</strong> contains the project without frame skipping or a restricted action space.</li>
<li><strong>actions.py</strong> contains the test program for mapping array indices to actions.</li>
<li>The <strong>replays</strong> folder contains several runs of the game sorted by distance reached, showing how the agent improved from the first few episodes on for the first four worlds.</li>
<li><strong>Project Proposal.pdf</strong> is a paper outlining the original intent and goals for the project.</li>
<li>The neural network <strong>weights</strong> can be found here for download: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/sb4ndc5cbw5oir5/AAAiVTG5-G5xeTVPhklBHn6aa?dl=0</li>

</ul>

Planned goals for the future of this project:

<ul>

<li>Have the agent play two levels simultaneously with one input for the controls</li>
<li>Complete multiple levels in a row (during the same run)</li>
<li>Obtain the maximum number of points</li>
<li>Defeat the most enemies</li>
<li>Collect the most coins</li>
<li>Obtain as many hidden items as possible</li>
<li>Find as many hidden paths as possible</li>

</ul>
