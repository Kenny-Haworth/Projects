# Super Mario Bros AI

This project uses machine learning techniques to train an agent to play the original NES Super Mario Bros.
It uses Deep Q Learning with a Convolutional Neural Network that is fed the raw pixel input of the game screen.

The agent was trained over several hundred game sessions, slowly getting better and better at the game.
This type of machine learning is known as reinforcement learning.

The replays folder contains several runs of the game, showing how the agent improved from the first few episodes on.
